   - Corrige la non détection du lien Ethernet, problème qui pouvait éventuellement arriver en
     connectant le câble Ethernet durant l'initialisation.
   - Corrige l'erreur d'unité des degrés K dans get_object.xml, ils sont exprimés en degrés C.
   - Corrige l'inversion d'état du contact Sensor dans la MIB Eaton PowerMIB pour UPS.
   - Dans la MIB Eaton PowerMIB pour UPS, une fausse valeur pouvait être retournée pour l'Oid
     .1.3.6.1.4.1.534.1.3.4.1.3 
     La valeur 0 est maintenant retournée pour tout autre donnée non gérée par l'onduleur.

                              ==================
                   
Problème corrigé :
   - Augmentation de la taille du buffer de téléchargement afin de pouvoir mettre à jour la NMC
     avec une version FA.  

Problèmes connus :
   - Les NMS qui réceptionnent les TRAPs ne sont pas supprimés du fichier ConfigurationData.xml
     lorsqu'on les supprime via la page Web ou via la fonction GetObject. Ils réapparaissent donc 
     après un Reset.
   - Les historiques et les notifications en température sont toujours en °C, même si le °F est
     l'unité sélectionnée.
   - Dans la page Configuration Système, non prise en compte de l'option "Conserver les paramètres IP",
     et non redémarrage lorsque l'on clique sur "Paramètres par défaut".

Améliorations:
   - L'adresse du serveur DHCP qui a servi la carte est sauvée en Flash,
     permettant à ce même serveur DHCP de servir la carte à son redémarrage.
